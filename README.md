#CloseMe

**CloseMe** is a simple open-source Chrome extension that will auto-close all the invasive pop-ups from the [Medium](https://medium.com) website.

Annoying, isn't it ? They are slowly getting better, but are way too invasive. . . 

## Usage

Simply install the extension and enjoy

## Phoning home

In an attempt to make a compelling case for how annoying those pop-ups are, I am collecting how many pop-ups have been closed over time. 
Nothing else. It is totally anonymous, and nothing else than an increment to a counter :).
